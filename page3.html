            <h4 style="text-align: justify">
                <p id="box1">Today we are familiar with several of hockey forms, including field hockey,
                    ice hockey, roller hockey and indoor hockey.
                    The most popular one is ice hockey, especially in Canada.
                    Regardless of the forms, hockey is a team sport in which two teams play against
                    each other by controlling a ball or a puck trying to get it into the opponent’s goal.
                    All players use hockey sticks during a game.</p>
                <p id="box2">It is impossible to claim the exact time of the birth of hockey. We will probably
                    never know for sure, but there are records of people participating in this kind of
                    game about 4000 years ago. Since ball-stick games are as old as our civilization,
                    the earliest origins may be from China, Persia or Egypt. Archeologists discovered
                    that an early form of the ball-and-stick game was played in Greece the 5th century BC.
                    At the time when Europeans sailed across the Atlantic and started settling North
                    America, they discovered that Native Indian people had their games which were precursors
                    of lacrosse. Furthermore, some museums today showcase evidence that hockey was played by
                    Aztecs centuries before Columbus even discovered the New World.</p>
                <p><img src="./img/hockey-history-17th-century.jpg" alt="hockey-history-17th-century"></p>
                <p id="box3">The name “hockey” is thought to be derived from the French hoquet meaning “shepherd’s
                        stave”,
                    however, there are a couple of suppositions of which none have been evidenced. The second
                    supposition derives from the use of cork bangs, called stoppers, in place of wooden balls
                    to play the game. These objects came from barrels containing hock ale, also known as hocky.
                    Still, though, the origin of “hockey” remains unclear.</p>
                <p id="box4">J. G. Creighton was the Canadian from Halifax, Nova Scotia who created the
                    first set of rules of ice hockey about 140 years ago. 
                    Upon arriving in Montreal, he presented hockey sticks
                    and skates which were patented by Nova Scotia company in 1866. The skates featured
                    rounded blades held onto boots by metal clamps, which had not been seen ever before.
                    The very first game of ice hockey played in Canada was in 1875 at Victoria Skating
                    Rink, in which the new rules were implemented. Just a couple of years later,
                    Mr. Creighton’s rules were revised at McGill University in Montreal. Eventually,
                    it was decided that the game would be held indoors for the first time, due to
                    the belief that ice hockey had to be played on ponds only. Otherwise, people could
                    get badly hurt. Creighton handled the issue by creating a flat and circular piece of
                    wood, that is the first hockey puck. It provided players with better control over a
                    ball, and it decreased the chance of injuring spectators during a game.
                </p>
                <p id="box5">Ice hockey is Canada’s national winter sport. The country undoubtedly contributed
                    to this sport more than any other so we could say this their tendency to regard
                    ice hockey as their national sport is entirely justified. The national hockey
                    league of North America, called NHL is the highest level for men’s hockey and
                    thus the most popular. In Russia and the most of Europe, the highest league is
                    called Kontinental Hockey League. The formal governing body of International
                    ice hockey is the International Ice Hockey Federation.</p>
                <p id="box6">The modern game was formed in the middle of 19th century by British soldiers
                    stationed in Canada. During the next 30 years, many leagues and amateur clubs
                    were organized in Canada. By the beginning of the 20th century, ice hockey
                    spread to England and the rest of European countries. Today, the sport is
                    highly popular in Eastern Europe and North America.</p>
                <p id="box7">Soft hockey has been played in the ancient period by different nations and
                    under different names. It is known that over the last five hundred years
                    the sport has been widely played in India and in rural areas of
                    undeveloped parts of the world where the lack of proper infrastructure
                    eliminates the probability for playing field hockey. In the past,
                    villagers were mixing the bamboo and homemade rubber to make softballs.
                    One of the reasons the sport enjoyed such a popularity was that it
                    didn’t require many players and the equipment for the game was very
                    simple. One of the more advantageous sides of softball was smaller
                    chances of sustaining injuries, compared to other similar games.
                    The game was played by pushing the ball instead of hitting it, to
                    avoid sending the ball out of the field and into bushes and ponds,
                    which would lead to a longer recovering from the ball. Over the
                    last couple of centuries, the sport has been modified and developed
                    into other separate sports like croquet, lacrosse, shinty, field
                    hockey, etc. According to sources, the countries which mostly
                    contributed to the development of hockey were Great Britain and
                    France, where field hockey remains to be a popular summer sport.
                    During cold, harsh winters in Europe, it was not uncommon to
                    see young athletes play the version of this sport on ice. In
                    the 17th century, the game started becoming popular in Holland
                    and then later on it started to take hold in England as well.</p>
                <p id="box8">The first Olympic Hockey Competition for men took place in London
                    in 1908 where all of the United Kingdom countries were competing
                    separately. Another two countries which participated as well were
                    Germany and France. However, after London Olympics, the game was
                    dropped from 1912 games held in Stockholm due to the preferences
                    of other ‘optional sports’ by the host country. Several years
                    later, in 1920, the ice hockey reappeared in Antwerp but was again
                    neglected in Paris in 1924, despite the formation of the
                    International Hockey Federation that same year. Ultimately,
                    hockey was granted re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928 and has been
                    on the program ever since. As for the women’s hockey, the first
                    time it was included in the Olympic program was in Moscow in 1980.</p>
                <p><img src="./img/hockey-match-1901.jpg" alt="hockey-match-1901"></p>
                <p id="box9">Since the Olympics held in Sydney (2000), men athletes have competed
                    in 12-team tournaments and women in a 10-team one.</p>
                <p id="box10">Another hockey sport, which was played for the first time in the city of
                    Kent, England at the beginning of the 20th century, is called “roller
                    skate hockey”. Apart from several European countries, the sport presently
                    enjoys popularity in South America, Angola, and Mozambique. The
                    International Federation of roller skate hockey was created in 1924.
                    The sport may be played on roller skates or roller blades. Two teams
                    comprise of six players each, so it closely resembles ice hockey.
                    However, it is played on asphalt or an indoor skating rink with a ball.
                    The minimum size of the playing area is minimally set to be 65 x 35 feet
                    while the maximum size is 100 x 200 feet. Same as indoor hockey, the
                    game starts with a face-off after a coin is tossed. The players’ positions
                    are a goalie, two forwards, center and two defenders. All players wear
                    matching jerseys, as well as a face mask, shin guards, hockey gloves and
                    helmets with a chin strap. They may also use a mouthpiece, but it is optional.</p>
                <p id="box11">Indoor hockey is very similar to field hockey but only adapted for indoor play.
                    However, the same playing style can be applied outdoors if the surface is flat,
                    hard and asphalted. Each team is created out of six players, and the game has two
                    periods of 20 minutes. One of the rules of the game is that the ball must only
                    be pushed and not hit with the stick. Additionally, the ball may just rise from
                    the surface while attempting to score a goal from the striking circle. The game
                    starts with a lateral pass from the team which loses a toss-up.</p>
