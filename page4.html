                <p id="box1">The National Hockey Association (NHA), the forerunner of the National
                    Hockey League (NHL), was organized in 1910 and became the strongest
                    hockey association in North America. Rising interest in the game
                    created problems, however, for there were few artificial-ice rinks.
                    In 1911 the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) was formed by
                    Joseph Patrick and his sons, who built two enclosed artificial-ice
                    arenas, beginning a boom in the construction of artificial-ice rinks.</p>
                <p id="box2">The PCHA became involved in a money and player war with the NHA.
                    Although the NHA ultimately emerged as the stronger league, it
                    was the PCHA that introduced many of the changes that improved
                    the game. The only radical rule change adopted by the NHA was to
                    reduce the number of players on a side to six, and that move was
                    made to save money. The western league retained seven-man hockey,
                    but it allowed the goalie to leap or dive to stop the puck. Under
                    the previous rules, a goalie had had to remain stationary when
                    making a save. The western league also changed the offside rule.
                    Under the old rules, a player had been deemed offside if he was
                    ahead of the puck carrier when he received a pass. The PCHA divided
                    the ice into three zones by painting two blue lines across the
                    surface and allowed forward passing in the centre zone between the
                    blue lines. This opened up the game and made it more exciting.
                    Another innovation in the western league was the idea of the assist.
                    Previously, only the goal scorer had been credited with a point.
                    In the PCHA the player or players who set up his goal were credited
                    with an assist. The first numbered uniforms also appeared in their league.</p>

                <p id="box4">Like some of its predecessors, the NHA had its dissenters.
                    In a move to eject one of the league members, the NHA decided
                    to disband and form a new league. The result was the creation
                    in 1917 of the National Hockey League (NHL), which became the
                    world’s foremost professional hockey league. In 1924 the first
                    U.S. team, the Boston Bruins, joined the NHL. In 1925 the
                    New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates were admitted,
                    followed in 1926 by the New York Rangers, the Chicago Blackhawks,
                    and the Detroit Cougars (later called the Red Wings).
                    To stock the new teams, the NHL bought out the Patricks’
                    league in 1926 for $250,000. Among the players who shifted
                    to Boston was Eddie Shore, known as a “rushing” defenseman,
                    whose style helped change the game. He was one of the sport’s
                    most ferocious and, many experts say, most skilled players,
                    a forerunner of such future NHL players as Gordie Howe, who
                    played mostly for the Detroit Red Wings. The Pittsburgh Pirates
                    and the New York Americans eventually dropped out of the league,
                    and, until the expansion of 1967, the NHL was composed of only
                    six teams: the Rangers, the Bruins, the Blackhawks, the
                    Red Wings, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
                <p id="box5">In 1967 the NHL undertook one of the greatest expansions in
                    professional sports history when it doubled in size to 12
                    teams. A new 12-team league, the World Hockey Association
                    (WHA), was formed in 1972, and the ensuing rivalry caused
                    an escalation in players’ salaries. In 1979 the NHL, which
                    had grown to 17 teams, merged with the WHA to become a
                    21-team league; by 2017, 31 teams played in the NHL. In
                    2004, owners locked out players, insisting that they accept
                    a salary cap that would slow the rapid growth of payroll
                    costs. The players rejected the owners’ demands, and the
                    entire 2004–05 season was canceled. (The league resumed
                    play in 2005–06 after the owners ultimately prevailed,
                    and the NHL became the last of the major North American
                    team-sport leagues to institute a salary cap.) The regular
                    season consists of 82 games and determines the 16 teams
                    that will qualify for the play-offs. The play-off winner
                    is awarded the Stanley Cup.</p>
                <p id="box6">NHL individual awards are the Vezina Trophy,
                    for the goalie voted best at his position by NHL managers;
                    the William M. Jennings Trophy, for the goalie or goalies
                    with the team permitting the fewest goals; the Calder
                    Memorial Trophy, for the rookie of the year; the Hart Memorial
                    Trophy, for the most valuable player; the James Norris Memorial
                    Trophy, for the outstanding defenseman; the Art Ross Trophy,
                    for the top point scorer; the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy,
                    for the player best combining clean play with a high degree
                    of skill; the Conn Smythe Trophy, for the play-offs’ outstanding
                    performer; the Frank J. Selke Trophy, for the best defensive
                    forward; the Jack Adams Award, for the coach of the year; the
                    Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, for the player who best
                    exemplifies sportsmanship, perseverance, and dedication to
                    hockey; and the Lester Patrick Trophy, for outstanding service
                    to U.S. hockey.</p>

                <p id="box8">For much of the 20th century, amateur athletes dominated international
                    competition. League competition among amateurs in England began in 1903.
                    The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) was formed in Europe
                    in 1908. Its five original members were Great Britain, Bohemia,
                    Switzerland, France, and Belgium. The first European championship
                    was held at Avants, Switzerland, in 1910, with Great Britain the
                    winner. From that time the federation broadened its membership,
                    taking applicants from the world over. Canada captured the first
                    Olympic Games title in 1920 and, concurrently, the first IIHF
                    world championship. Canada, which also won at the first Olympic
                    Winter Games in 1924, dominated international competition until
                    the emergence of the Soviet team in the early 1960s. The Soviets
                    continued to be the most powerful team in international hockey
                    until the 1990s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p id="box9">In 1995 an agreement between the NHL, the NHL Players’ Association,
                    and the IIHF ended amateur domination of international play
                    as professional athletes were allowed to compete at the Olympics
                    and World Cup championships. Although the decision had little
                    effect on the world tournament, the Winter Games competition
                    underwent numerous changes. Given the high visibility of professional
                    players and their skills, selection to the Canadian, U.S., Russian,
                    Finnish, Swedish, and Czech Olympic teams was no longer based on
                    tryouts but rather on the decisions of hockey personnel from each country’s
                    national hockey governing body. The six "dream teams" were
                    automatically placed in the final round of eight; the two remaining
                    slots were filled by the winners of a qualifying round. The NHL
                    suspended play for a period of 16 days in 1998 so professional players
                    could make their Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan, and it continued to
                    temporarily stop the season for Olympic play thereafter.</p>

                    for over 100 years. The first all-female game was in Barrie,

                    held in 1990. Recognizing the growing popularity of the sport,
                    the International Olympic Committee added women’s ice hockey to
                    its 1998 schedule at Nagano, where the sport made its first Winter
                    Games appearance.</p>
