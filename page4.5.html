            <h1 id="box">Rink and equipment</h1>
            <br>
            <h4 style="text-align: justify">
                <p><img src="./img/field.jpg" alt="field"></p>
                <p id="box1">NHL hockey is typically played on a standard-size rink shaped
                    like a round-cornered rectangle that is 200 feet (61 metres)
                    long and 85 feet (26 metres) wide. International rinks are usually
                    184–200 feet by 85–98 feet, and U.S. college rinks are typically
                    200 feet by 100 feet. The goal cage is 4 feet (1.2 metres) high
                    and 6 feet (1.8 metres) wide. Any shot that completely clears the
                    goal line, a 2-inch- (5-cm-) wide stripe on the ice across the
                    front of the cage, is a goal. In front of the goal is the crease,
                    a semicircular area that corresponds to a circle with a 6-foot
                    radius, demarcated by a red line. When the goalie is in the crease,
                    no attacking player may enter unless the puck is there as well;
                    if the goalie is not in the crease, however, anyone may enter. The
                    blue lines that divide the ice into three zones are 60 feet
                    (18 metres) out from the goal line and are painted across the width
                    of the ice. The area between the blue lines is called the neutral
                    zone. This zone is bisected by the red centre line.</p>
                <p id="box2">Virtually all equipment—for children, amateurs, or professionals—is
                    the same. Made of vulcanized rubber, the puck is 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick
                    and 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and weighs 5.5 to 6 ounces
                    (156 to 170 grams). Hockey sticks, once made from wood, are now formed
                    from a variety of materials. Rules are enforced limiting the size of
                    the stick and the curvature of its blade. Forwards and defensemen wear
                    the same type of skates, but goaltenders have flatter blades because
                    they need more balance and are stationary for longer periods. The shoes
                    of goaltenders’ skates are fitted with rubber protection for the toes.
                    Players wear padding under their uniforms to protect legs, shoulders,
                    and arms. Since 1979–80 all players entering the NHL must wear helmets;
                    helmets and face masks are mandatory in National Collegiate Athletic
                    Association (NCAA) and IIHF play. The goaltender wears a specially
                    designed mask (often molded to the contours of his face).</p>
                <p id="box3">Over his uniform a goalie wears extra equipment. Pads up to 11
                    inches (25.4 cm) wide protect him from the tips of his skates
                    to above his knees. They not only afford protection but also aid
                    in blocking shots. On his free hand the goalie wears a glove similar
                    to a first baseman’s baseball mitt, with a wide webbing that enables
                    him to catch the puck. The stick hand is encased in a glove with a
                    wide backing that protects his arm. The goalie’s stick has a wider
                    shaft and blade than those of the other players. Fully dressed,
                    goaltenders carry up to 40 pounds (18 kg) of equipment.</p>

            <br>
            <h4 style="text-align: justify">
                <p><img src="./img/referee.jpg" alt="referee"></p>
                <p id="box5">The modern game on every level—amateur, collegiate, international,
                    and professional—has been influenced largely by the NHL.</p>
                <p id="box6">Checking—body contact to take an opponent out of play—is permitted
                    anywhere on the ice. In most leagues, including the NHL, players
                    may not make or take a pass that has traveled across the two blue
                    lines; if this occurs, the play is ruled offside. A face-off, in
                    which an official drops the puck between opposing players, follows
                    the infraction. Face-offs are held at the point of the infraction.
                    Players who precede the puck into the attacking zone also are ruled
                    offside, and a face-off is held at a face-off spot near the attacking
                    blue line. A face-off also begins each period and is used as well
                    after a goal and after any stoppage of play.</p>
                <p id="box7">The goalie rarely leaves his goal area. The usual alignments of
                    the other five players are three forwards—the centre, a left wing,
                    and a right wing—and two defensemen—a left defenseman and
                    a right defenseman.</p>
                <p id="box8">A player may handle the puck as often or as long as he likes,
                    so long as he does not close his glove on the puck or touch
                    the puck with a stick that is higher than shoulder level.
                    A player may not pass the puck with his open hand. The goalie,
                    however, is generally not subject to these restrictions.</p>
                <p id="box9">The game is divided into three periods of 20 minutes playing time
                    each, with a 15-minute intermission between periods. Hockey games
                    may end in a tie unless the rules stipulate an overtime period
                    to serve as a tiebreaker. In the case of a tie in college hockey,
                    one 10-minute sudden-death overtime period is played in regular
                    season play. NHL teams play a five-minute sudden-death overtime
                    period, followed by a shoot-out if the game remains tied. During
                    the play-offs, college hockey has 10-minute overtime periods
                    until there is a winner, while the NHL has the same system with
                    20-minute periods. There is generally no overtime period in
                    international hockey; however, Olympic competition since 1994
                    has had a 10-minute sudden-death period, followed by a shootout
                    if needed.</p>
                <p id="box10">In organized ice hockey a victory is worth two points in the standings.
                    A tie is worth one point, and the NHL, which has no ties, awards a
                    point to a team that loses in overtime. A goal counts as a point for
                    the team, but individual points may be awarded to as many as three
                    players for one goal. One point goes to the player who scored the
                    goal, and a point is awarded for an assist to each of the last two
                    of the scorer’s teammates who touched the puck, providing that the
                    opposition did not handle the puck in the interim.</p>
                <p id="box11">Ice hockey is the only major sport in which substitutions are
                    permitted while the game is in play. The game is so fast and
                    so demanding that forwards generally skate only 90 seconds at
                    a time. Defensemen usually stay on the ice for a slightly
                    longer period of time.</p>
                <p id="box12">Because of the speed and contact, there are many infractions,
                    not all of them having to do with "hitting" penalties.
                    Play is stopped for an offside and for the infraction called
                    icing, which occurs when a team shoots the puck out of its
                    zone past the other team’s goal line. Icing is not called
                    against a team when it is shorthanded; if the teams are
                    evenhanded or if the offending team has more players than
                    the opposing team, the puck is returned to the defensive
                    zone of the team that iced it for the face-off. No player,
                    however, may delay the game by intentionally shooting the
                    puck out of the rink or by shifting the goalposts.</p>
                <p id="box13">Minor penalties are most commonly assessed for excessive
                    use of the body or equipment to impede the opposition.
                    For a minor infraction the offending player must remain
                    in the penalty box at the side of the rink for two minutes
                    while his team plays shorthanded. This man-advantage
                    situation is called a power play. If the opponents score
                    at any time during the penalty period, the penalized
                    player may return to the ice. Penalties incurred by the
                    goalie are served by a teammate. A major penalty for
                    violent play results in the loss of a player for five
                    minutes or for the remainder of the game. If major penalties
                    are incurred simultaneously by both teams, substitutions
                    are made and there is no shorthanded play. A game misconduct
                    penalty for abusing an official results in the loss of a
                    player for 10 minutes; however, a substitution is allowed,
                    and the team does not play shorthanded.</p>
                <p id="box14">There are three common types of shots in hockey: the slap
                    shot, the wrist shot, and the backhander. The slap shot
                    has been timed at more than 100 miles an hour (160 km an hour).
                    The slap shot differs from the wrist shot in that the player
                    brings his stick back until it is nearly perpendicular with
                    the ice and then brings the stick down in an arc, swatting
                    the puck as he follows through. It is not as accurate as the
                    wrist shot, in which the player puts his stick on the ice
                    near the puck and without a windup snaps his wrist to fire
                    off a shot. The backhander is taken when the puck goes to
                    the other side of the stick from which the player normally
                    shoots. If he is a right-handed shooter, for example, he
                    takes the backhander from his left side. It is taken when
                    there is not enough time to shift the puck to his normal
                    shooting position. The backhander generally is not as hard
                    or as accurate as the wrist shot, but it has the advantage
                    of being taken quickly.</p>
